## Practice Problem

**Problem 1: Convert and Print**

Write a C++ program that takes an integer input from the user in decimal form and prints its equivalent in octal, hexadecimal, and binary formats.

**Problem 2: Calculate and Compare**

Write a program to define variables in all numeral systems (decimal, octal, hexadecimal, and binary) for the same number. Perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on these variables and print the results in all formats.

**Problem 3: User Input Conversion**

Modify the original program to accept user input in any numeral system (octal, hexadecimal, or binary) and then display the corresponding decimal value.

**Problem 4: Bitwise Operations**

Given an integer, apply different bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT) on it and display the results in decimal, octal, hexadecimal, and binary forms.

**Problem 5: Validate Input**

Write a C++ program that takes input as a string and determines if itâ€™s a valid decimal, octal, hexadecimal, or binary number. If valid, convert it to the other numeral systems and print the results.

**Problem 6: Powers of Two**

Write a program that prints the first 16 powers of 2 in decimal, octal, hexadecimal, and binary formats.

**Problem 7: Sum of Numeral System Numbers**

Write a program that accepts two numbers from the user in any numeral system (decimal, octal, hexadecimal, binary) and prints their sum in all numeral systems.
